Design Patterns
=============

Little playground exploring and implementing design patterns.

To kick things off simply cd into the project root and type:

    npm install

This will be setup jasmine/karma and code coverage. Then you can simply type:

    grunt

And then you should see something like this:

    Running "jshint:all" (jshint) task
    >> 3 files lint free.

    Running "karma:unit" (karma) task
    INFO [karma]: Karma v0.10.10 server started at http://localhost:9876/
    INFO [launcher]: Starting browser PhantomJS
    INFO [PhantomJS 1.9.7 (Windows 8)]: Connected on socket fkoSEVT4nQMxYwPokTjT
    PhantomJS 1.9.7 (Windows 8): Executed 6 of 6 SUCCESS (0.172 secs / 0.024 secs)
